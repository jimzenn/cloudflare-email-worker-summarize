# AI-Powered Email Automation Engine

<p>
  <strong>Tired of drowning in an endless flood of emails? This project transforms your inbox from a chaotic chore into an intelligent, automated assistant. It's a serverless email automation engine that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to read, understand, and act on your emails, so you don't have to.</strong>

## ‚ú® Imagine Your Inbox, Supercharged
This isn't just about filtering spam; it's about reclaiming your focus. With this engine running, you can:

-   **üóìÔ∏è Never miss a deadline:** Bills and invoices are automatically parsed for amounts and due dates, with summaries sent directly to you.
-   **‚úàÔ∏è Streamline your travel:** Flight and hotel confirmations are instantly recognized, with itineraries summarized and ready to be added to your calendar with a single click.
-   **üì∞ Stay informed, not overwhelmed:** Long newsletters and promotional emails are condensed into need-to-know summaries.
-   **‚úÖ Automate your schedule:** Event invitations and booking confirmations can be added to your Google Calendar automatically.

## üöÄ Core Functionality

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Event & Reservation Processing** | Extracts event details from confirmation emails (e.g., flights, hotels) and offers one-click calendar integration. |
| **Structured Data Extraction** | Parses unstructured emails like bills and invoices into structured JSON, identifying key information like due dates and amounts. |
| **Content Summarization** | Condenses newsletters and promotional emails into concise summaries. |
| **Automated Notifications** | Delivers processed information via formatted Telegram messages with interactive components. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture & Data Flow

1.  **Email Ingestion (Cloudflare Email Routing):** Emails are piped directly to a Cloudflare Worker, which triggers the processing pipeline.
2.  **AI-Powered Triage:** An initial LLM call categorizes the email (e.g., `event`, `bill`, `newsletter`) and performs a preliminary cleaning of the email body to remove signatures and boilerplate text.
3.  **Modular Handler Dispatch:** Based on the category, the system dispatches the email to a specialized handler module. This modular design isolates logic for each email type, making the system easy to extend.
4.  **Schema-Driven Information Extraction:** The dedicated handler invokes a second, more targeted LLM call. It uses a Zod schema to enforce structured output, ensuring the data returned by the LLM is predictable, validated, and type-safe.
5.  **Action & Notification:**
    *   The structured data is used to format a detailed message sent via the Telegram API.
    *   For actionable items like events, the Telegram message includes an inline keyboard button.
    *   User interaction with the button triggers a `callback_query` webhook. The worker handles this by retrieving the full event context from a Cloudflare KV store and executing the requested action, such as creating a Google Calendar event.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technical Highlights

| Highlight | Description |
|---|---|
| **Serverless Architecture** | The entire application is deployed as a Cloudflare Worker, running on the edge for low latency and high availability without managing any server infrastructure. |
| **Multi-Stage LLM Chain** | The system employs a two-stage LLM process: a broad categorization followed by a fine-tuned, schema-enforced extraction. This improves both accuracy and cost-efficiency over a single, complex prompt. |
| **Schema-Enforced LLM Output** | By integrating Zod schemas with the LLM prompting, the system guarantees reliable, type-safe JSON output from the model, eliminating the need for fragile string parsing and runtime validation of the AI's response. |
| **Stateful Actions in a Stateless Environment** | Manages stateful user interactions (e.g., "Add to Calendar" clicks) in a stateless serverless environment by persisting event data in Cloudflare KV, bridging the gap between the initial notification and a future user callback. |
| **Extensible, Handler-Based Design** | The core logic is built around a base handler class with specialized implementations for different email categories. This object-oriented pattern allows for rapid development of new email processing capabilities. |
| **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** | Project configuration, including environment variables and KV namespace bindings, is managed declaratively through the `wrangler.toml` file, enabling reproducible deployments. |
