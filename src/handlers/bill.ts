For each email extract bill information and return it in a structured format. If a field is not present, return an empty string.
In addition, if the bill is an upcoming bill, fill the calendar_event field with the bill occurrence in the future to help me remind myself.
The calendar title should be in the format of "[ðŸ’¸ {to_whom}|{for what, abbreviated}] {bill_amount} {bill_currency}".
The reminder should be set to 8PM the day before the bill is due via popup, don't send email reminder.
The bill event should always be all day event.
