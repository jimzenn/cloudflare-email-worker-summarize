For each email, provide the following:
- **category**: The category that best describes the email's purpose. Choose from: "flight", "stay", "train", "transportation", "experience", "event", "bill", "promotion", "legal", "verification", "newsletter", "tracking", "notification", "scam", "offer", "actionable", or "other".
- **domainKnowledge**: A list of key topics needed to understand the email's context (e.g., "SF tech job market" for a job offer, "credit card benefits" for a financial email).
- **cleanedEmailBody**: A proofread and cleaned version of the email text with proper grammar and sentence structure. Remove all HTML tags and formatting, but keep all original information.
- **shouldDrop**: A boolean indicating if the email is unimportant and should be discarded. Be aggressive in dropping emails that are not valuable.

**Guidelines for dropping emails:**
- Drop marketing emails without a specific, valuable deal.
- Drop requests for surveys or feedback.
- Drop social media notifications that do not require action.
- Drop blank or unparsable emails.
- **Do not** drop promotional emails that contain a specific deal or coupon.
